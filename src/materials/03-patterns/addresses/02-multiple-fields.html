notes: |
    Only use multiple address fields when you know which regions the addresses will come from and can find a format that supports them all. This can be difficult to know if you’re asking for addresses outside the UK.

    **Advantages of multiple fields**

    Multiple fields mean:
    - you can easily extract and use specific parts of an address (for example, street names or postcodes)
    - you can give help for individual fields
    - you can validate each part of the address separately
    - users can complete the form using their browser’s auto-complete function

    **Disadvantages of multiple fields**

    Multiple fields have these disadvantages:
    - it’s hard to find a single format that works for all addresses
    - there’s no guarantee that users will use the fields the way you think they will
    - users can’t easily paste addresses from their clipboard
