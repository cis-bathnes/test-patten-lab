notes: |
    Use a single text field labelled ‘National Insurance number’, like this:

    You should also:
    - allow for 13 characters - National Insurance numbers are often spaced in pairs
    - avoid using ‘NINO’ or ‘NI number’ as the label
    - avoid using ‘AB 12 34 56 C’ as an example (it belongs to a real person) - use ‘QQ 12 34 56 C’ instead

        <br>
        For example, ‘QQ 12 34 56 C’.
    </span>
