Start by adding the following files to your page:

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://bathnes-test.surge.sh/assets/patterns/styles/screen.css">`

`<script src="http://bathnes-test.surge.sh/assets/patterns/scripts/app.js"></script>`

These will give you everything you need to include the styles, components and patterns in your website. You can simply build it using the HTML found in this toolkit.
