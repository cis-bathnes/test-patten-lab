### Downloading the repo

Download the repo from <https://github.com/cis-bathnes/pattern-lib>

If you clone a project with the toolkit submodules installed you will need to initialise the submodules with the following command in terminal:

`git submodule init`

This pulls down the files from the submodules.

To update the toolkit to the latest version's of the toolkit repository's submodules you can use:

`git submodule update`

Or, if you're using [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com), you can double click on the submenus to update them and make sure the files have been pulled down.

`npm start`

Note - these instructions are from a Mac. We'll add instructions as to how to run this on PCs and VMs soon.
